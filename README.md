A LC3 virtual machine implementation in a few lines of C code.

Code is experimental. Things are not final.

The machine should be able to run simple LC3 programs.

Compile the sample program:

`gcc -Wall -std=c11 simple_program.c`

Compile the `vm`:

`gcc -Wall -std=c11 vm.c vm_dbg.c`

Run the program:

`./a.out simple_program.obj`
